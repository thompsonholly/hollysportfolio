Currently, two official plugins are available:



* An image of the deployed application (either a short animated GIF or screenshot)

* The title of the project

* A link to the deployed application

* A link to the corresponding GitHub repository

Future employers will view the portfolio and see all of my early work, and continuing skills as a potential employee. 


## Tech Featured
- Modern [React](https://react.dev/) front-end, built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), using React Context for storage of global user state.
- Some [Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/) integration to tidy things up a bit.
- JavaScript to create and help with the funtionality of the page.
